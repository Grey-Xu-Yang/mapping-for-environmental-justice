# mapping-for-environmental-justice

Welcome to the Mapping for Environmental Justice(MEJ) repo! MEJ aims to create easy-to-use, publicly-available maps that paint a holistic picture of intersecting environmental, social, and health impacts experienced by communities across the US.

With guidance from the residents of impacted communities, MEJ combines environmental, public health, and demographic data into an indicator of vulnerability for communities in every state. These maps create a powerful picture of environmental justice by combining individual indicators to paint a holistic picture of the cumulative impacts experienced by different communities. MEJâ€™s goal is to fill an existing data gap for individual states without environmental justice mapping tools, and to provide a valuable tool for advocates, scholars, students, lawyers, and policy makers. 

This repo contains MEJ's code for processing and combining environmental, demographic, and health data into a census-level EJ score.
